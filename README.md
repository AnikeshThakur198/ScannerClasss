# ScannerClasss
Well Scanner class have many methods but these two are like magical methods for me:-
    -The first one is .next() which has a disadvantage 
    that is it only reads a word at a time, and has an 
    advantage that it skips the string that get created
    by pressing the enter key.
    -The next one is .nextLine() which reads the whole 
    line but also consider the enter key as a string..
